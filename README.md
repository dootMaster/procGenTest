# procGenTest

This repo contains a test of a procedural generation algorithm for 2d rooms. I altered what I learned from a tutorial to handle a more complex tileset. The most current test I've worked on is contained in the procGen2 folder.
I made a function that also helps with prioritizing specific tiles from a set. In the future, I'll be working on procedural generation for object layers in the room, such as scene traversal objects, game entities, and room decorations.
